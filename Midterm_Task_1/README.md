### Midterm Lab Task 1
For this task, we are given a flat data file from Excel (See raw file), and we need to perform Data Cleaning and Preparation.
# STEP for Data Cleaning Process
- **Step One**: Select the column or table, then go to Data â†’ Remove Duplicates to clean duplicates.
Use Filter to find empty cells and remove or fill missing data appropriately. 
- **Step Two**: Format all dates, numbers, and text to be consistent. Use TRIM() to remove extra spaces and PROPER() to standardize capitalization.
- **Step Three**: Use Find & Replace to fix incorrect values.
Apply Data Validation to prevent incorrect entries.
Check for outliers using Conditional Formatting.
